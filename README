DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository includes a python script meant to show the 
numerical representation and modularity of code libraries 
as well as images (PNG). Since images are simply represented
by 1's and 0's on a hardware level, programmers (or anyone 
for that matter) can alter the image by changing the bits 
used to store the image. This script implements many different
alterations to an image such as grayscale, pixel manipulation,
and image transposing. 

HOW TO RUN
----------
In a terminal window with Python 3 installed, navigate to the 
directory containing ImageFuzz.py and run the command:
	
	"python3 ImageFuzz.py"

Follow the prompts given to you by the program. Once the script 
is done running, you should have a variety of PNG files in your
current directory which are alterations of the file given to 
the script.
